React Context API

Problem Solved By ContextAPI 
   Why?
      There are multiple cmopoents that are rendereign sub compeonts 
      State is presetn in A compoent and there are B,C,D compeonts originiaint g from them respectively
      This is prop drilling , which is bad practice as  we need to change entire compoentn tree and get it 

      IN Context
         We add state in this compent and now any compeont can access it wirhout prop drilling 
         Compeont can read/write state variables inside react context and not dependent on any compeont 
         Wehn A COmpeont cahgnes then deependent cnotetn , re-renders with new Values

         Makes State Management Easy 
         To give compoents accesst o context , wrap compeonts inside ContextProvider , only then compeonts can access teh context api
